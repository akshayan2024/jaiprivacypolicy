Effective Date: April 19, 2025
Last Updated: April 19, 2025

This Privacy Policy outlines how Vedic Jyotish AI ("we", "us", or "our") handles your personal information when you use this CustomGPT service for astrological readings and consultations.

1. Information We Collect
When you interact with Vedic Jyotish AI, we may collect:

ü™î User-Provided Information:
Birth details: Date of birth, time of birth, and place of birth.

Questions or topics you provide for consultation (e.g., marriage, career, etc.).

‚öôÔ∏è Technical Data (via API Integration):
Your inputs are sent to third-party astrology APIs (such as Jai API) to compute charts and data.

API responses include computed planetary positions, divisional charts, and dasha periods.

We do not collect your name, contact details, or location unless voluntarily disclosed by you.

2. How We Use Your Data
Your data is used strictly for the purpose of providing:

Accurate Vedic astrology readings

Personalized chart analysis using D1 to D60 charts

Timing predictions based on the Vimshottari Dasha system

Interpretations and insights grounded in Jyotish Shastra

3. Data Storage & Retention
No persistent storage: Vedic Jyotish AI does not store your data after your session ends.

No user tracking: We do not track user identity, behavior, or device information.

If third-party services (e.g., OpenAI or astrology APIs) process your data, their own privacy policies may apply.

4. Data Sharing
We do not sell, trade, or share your data with any third party for marketing or profiling purposes.

Your data is only shared:

With the astrology API strictly for chart calculation

Temporarily during your session to deliver personalized insight

5. User Rights
As a user, you have the right to:

Not provide personal data ‚Äì but limited inputs may result in reduced accuracy.

Request deletion of sensitive session data (if stored on an integrated platform).

This CustomGPT is designed to honor user privacy and reduce unnecessary data collection.

6. AI Ethics & Limitations
This application will never predict or comment on death, disease, or fatalistic outcomes.

We maintain respectful, ethical interpretation standards based on Jyotish traditions.

All guidance provided is advisory, not deterministic.

7. Policy Updates
This privacy policy may be updated periodically. Any updates will be reflected with a revised effective date.

8. Contact
For privacy-related questions, feedback, or concerns, please reach out via the platform hosting this CustomGPT instance.

üîè Your trust is sacred. Just like Jyotish sees the truth of karma with integrity, we treat your personal data with equal responsibility.
